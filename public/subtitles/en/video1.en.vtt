00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
take chances, professionally.

4
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Don't be afraid to fail.
There's an old I.Q test

5
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
was 9 dots and you had to draw five lines

6
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
with a pencil within these 9 dots

7
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
without lifting the pencil

8
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
the only way to do it was to go outside the box

9
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
so, don't be afraid to go outside the box

10
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
don't be afraid to think outside the box

11
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000
don't be afraid to fail big, to dream big.
